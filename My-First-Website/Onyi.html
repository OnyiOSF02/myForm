        <p> Is it a place or a feeling? I think the definiton is shifting. To some it means security and safety while to some, it may mean uncertainty. </p>
        <p> One thing we can all agree on is that everyone needs a place to lay their head on at the end of the day. </p>
        <p> We recently conducted a survey on people of different ages asking them which they will prefer, owning a home or renting one and the answers we got were quite interesting. </p>
